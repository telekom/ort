/**
 * A data class that represents the graph of dependencies of a project.
 *
 * This class holds information about a project's scopes and their dependencies in a format that minimizes the
 * consumption of memory. In projects with many scopes there is often a high degree of duplication in the
 * dependencies of the scopes. To avoid this, this class aims to share as many parts of the dependency graph as
 * possible between the different scopes. Ideally, there is only a single dependency graph containing the dependencies
 * used by all scopes. This is not always possibles due to inconsistencies in dependency relations, like a package
 * using different dependencies in different scopes. Then the dependency graph is split into multiple fragments, and
 * each fragment has a consistent view on the dependencies it contains.
 *
 * To further reduce memory consumption, package identifiers are not repeated, but are listed once and then referenced
 * by indices. The storage format defined by this class is not really human-readable, but it causes a significant
 * reduction of memory usage. On deserialization, the information stored can be manually converted again to a structure
 * with [Scope] and [PackageReference] objects (with shared references, so keeping memory consumption low, too), so
 * that it can be processed in the usual ways.
